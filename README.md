# Forge-1.19-Test

I want to get into Minecraft forge modding. This project is where I will be testing around with forge. 

The main mod class is called ItemTest.java (now looking back, probably not the best name)

All data generation is done apart from lang (because I find it easier to manually write the JSON file) and loot tables (I have not got round to implementing data generation for loot tables)

I used the Forge Forums and mainly Jorrit Tyberghein (Youtube) for help using forge.

Thanks!
